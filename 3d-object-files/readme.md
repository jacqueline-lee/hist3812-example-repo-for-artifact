# Object Files

Autodesk Recap automatically uploads the files to their web app Autodesk 360 when you create a mesh. I have had varying degrees of success viewing the .obj file itself on the web app but I am not sure if it is the web app that is unreliable or my computer that is the issue. The model of the Mayfair Theatre, including all the requisite .obj, .mtl, and .png files, is available for download at [this link](http://autode.sk/2nE4Apw).
