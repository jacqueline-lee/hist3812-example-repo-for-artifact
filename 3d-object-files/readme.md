# Object Files

In this folder please put the .obj, .mtl, and .png files that are created by the photogrammetry process.

It might be that Github tells you that the file is too big. In that case, modify this readme file to tell me where I might find (and be able to download) your model. In most cases, this will be [sketchfab.com](http://sketchfab.com). Here is a [quickstart guide to sketchfab](https://help.sketchfab.com/hc/en-us/articles/203994889-Quick-Start-Guide).


Autodesk Recap automatically uploads the files to their web app Autodesk 360 when you create a mesh. I have had varying degrees of success viewing the .obj file itself on the web app but I am not sure if it is the web app that is unreliable or my computer that is the issue. The scan is available for download at [this link](http://autode.sk/2nE4Apw).
